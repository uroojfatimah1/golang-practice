A channel is a typed conduit through which goroutines can send and receive values safely.

Declaration:

ch := make(chan int)   // unbuffered channel
ch := make(chan int, 3) // buffered channel with capacity 3

Sending a value: ch <- 5

Receiving a value: x := <- ch

Channels are blocking by default:

Sending blocks until another goroutine receives.

Receiving blocks until a value is sent.
