A race condition happens when two or more goroutines access the same variable concurrently, and at least one of them is writing.

The final result depends on timing, which can be unpredictable.

Race conditions lead to bugs that are very hard to reproduce.

Think of it as two chefs trying to add ingredients to the same pot at the same time — the final taste may vary depending on who added what first.
