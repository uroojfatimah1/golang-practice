What is a Mutex?

A mutex (short for mutual exclusion) is a lock that ensures only one goroutine can access a shared resource at a time.

Used to prevent race conditions when multiple goroutines read/write the same variable.

Go provides sync.Mutex for this purpose.

Think of it as a “do not disturb” sign for your shared variable:

Lock it before modifying.

Unlock it after done.
